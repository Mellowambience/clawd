- Ran workspace-wide code quality scan and log triage.
- Fixed audio field LFO wiring bug in `mycelium/static/dashboard/audio_field.js`.
- Updated `vessel/app.py` to probe MIST gateway via WebSocket handshake to stop handshake errors from raw TCP checks.
- Hardened `scripts/clawtasks_bounty_hunter.py` against non-list bounties and fixed stats update in submit path.
- Added port 18789 cleanup to `mycelium/start_hub.bat`.
- Suppressed gateway error spam on closed websockets in `moltbot/gateway/server.py`.

- Converted Tauri shrine index to floating companion orb UI (300x300, draggable, idle shrink, audio drone, tension polling).
- Added Tauri tray icon state updates (normal/cyan/red/idle) with generated tinted icons.
- Added global hotkey Win+Shift+L via tauri-plugin-global-shortcut and OS notifications via tauri-plugin-notification.
- Updated Tauri config for orb window and bundled tray resources.
- Hardened MistGateway tool parsing and prompt leak suppression in `moltbot/gateway/server.py` (robust JSON extraction, avoid leaking [INSTRUCTIONS]/[TOOLS], tool-only output guidance).
- Added silence-request handling and memory sanitization to reduce prompt/tool leakage in `moltbot/gateway/server.py`.
- Stripped system prompt references to personal ide/tool/root access and disabled streaming (buffered full response + filter) in `moltbot/gateway/server.py`.
- Added silence flag support and Win+Alt+Q tray toggle (creates data/silence.flag) in Tauri app.
- Updated `mycelium/dashboard_v3.html` to render final (non-streaming) messages.
- Hardened MistGateway output filter with regex-based sanitize response (tool/path evasion).
- Added input-based voiding for tool/path patterns and normalized suppression to single glyph in gateway sanitizer; restarted and retested.
