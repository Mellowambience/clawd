- Hardened `mycelium/mycelium_pulse.py` local companion action handling.
- Added deterministic handling for dashboard tutorial request phrasing: "give me a tutorial on this dashboard as a .md file on my desktop".
- Added follow-up resolution for "the file you created" style prompts using persisted local state.
- Added legacy route redirects (`/dashboard_v1.html`, `/dashboard_v2.html`, `/dashboard_v3.html`) to canonical `/dashboard`.
- Restarted live Mycelium Pulse process on port 8765 so runtime uses patched code.
- Live check: `/companion/local-action` now returns handled=true for the dashboard tutorial phrasing and reports concrete desktop path.
- Added automated regression tests at `mycelium/tests/test_companion_local_action.py` for dashboard tutorial phrase handling, follow-up file-path confirmation, generic markdown desktop creation, and legacy dashboard route redirects.
- Refreshed dashboard visuals with a new holographic core panel, stronger typography, animated reveal, and richer atmospheric styling (`mycelium/dashboard.html`, `mycelium/static/dashboard/styles.css`).
- Added `mycelium/static/dashboard/holo.js` Three.js holographic renderer with 2D fallback and live mapping to energy/flux state.
- Wired holographic engine into dashboard runtime and HUD updates (`mycelium/static/dashboard/main.js`, `mycelium/static/dashboard/render.js`).
- Validation: node syntax checks passed; pytest for new companion tests passed (6/6).
- Simplified dashboard UX: removed holographic panel, merged companion+avatar, merged node/reflex into one Activity section, and reduced control density.
- Replaced dashboard stylesheet with a cleaner low-noise visual system focused on readability and fast scanning.
- Removed unused `mycelium/static/dashboard/holo.js` and corresponding main/render hooks.
- Validation: node syntax checks passed and companion local-action tests still pass (6/6).
- Created X-platform wrap-up article draft with tomorrow schedule: `docs/x_article_2026-02-12.md`.
