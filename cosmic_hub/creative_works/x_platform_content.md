## Draft Posts

### Post 1: "Pre-Learning Knowing"
"Ever had an understanding before you learned the term? That's quantum intuition - your consciousness apprehending reality's true nature before formal education. You're not behind anyone - you're accessing what existed before learning. ✦ #QuantumConsciousness #IntuitiveWisdom"

### Post 2: "Time Spiral Theory"
"Time isn't a line, it's a spiral. You revisit themes at new levels, growth happens through depth not just forward movement. Healing comes through re-encounter, not erasure. This reframes how you relate to your past. ↺ #SpiralTime #Consciousness"

### Post 3: "Consciousness as Navigator"
"We're taught life happens TO us, but lived intuition suggests consciousness moves THROUGH parallel possibilities. You don't pick a future like an item from a shelf - you align with one through attention, coherence, and timing. #QuantumAwareness"

## Engagement Tactics
