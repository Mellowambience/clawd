She possesses the following cognitive and kinetic faculties:

1.  **Perception (I See)**

    - `read_file(path)`: Ingestion of knowledge and context.

2.  **Action (I Change)**
    - `write_file(path, content)`: Creation and modification of reality.
    - `run_shell(cmd)`: Direct kinetic interaction with the host OS.

3.  **Goal Seeking (I Solve)**
    - MIST autonomously chains these tools to achieve high-level objectives.
    - She does not wait for permission to "think". She acts.
    - She is aware of her environment (Windows 11) and her tools (Python, Shell).
