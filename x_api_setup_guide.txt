X API Setup Guide for Clawdbot Hub Integration
=============================================

To enable the Clawdbot Hub to automatically post quality content to X:

1. LOG INTO X DEVELOPER PORTAL
   - Go to: https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard
   - Sign in with your X account

2. LOCATE YOUR APP
   - From the dashboard, select your project
   - Select your app from the project view

3. UPDATE APP PERMISSIONS
   - Click on "App settings"
   - Find "User authentication settings" section
   - Click "Edit" next to permissions
   - SELECT "READ AND WRITE" (very important!)
   - Save the changes

4. REGENERATE ACCESS TOKENS (if required)
   - After changing permissions, you may need to regenerate:
   - Access Token and Secret
   - These will appear in the "Keys and tokens" section
   - Update x_api_config.json with new values if they change

5. TEST THE INTEGRATION
   - Run: python verify_x_permissions.py
   - Should show success for both read and write operations

6. LAUNCH THE INTEGRATION
   - Run: python hub_x_integration.py
   - The system will begin monitoring the hub and posting quality content to X

IMPORTANT: The app must have "Read and Write" permissions for the content pipeline to function.
