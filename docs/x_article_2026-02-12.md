# Shipped Today: Making MIST More Real, Less Hallucinated
**Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Format:** X Platform Article Draft

## Update (Friday, February 13, 2026)
- Added backend response validator endpoint: `POST /companion/validate-response`.
- Added an 11-prompt hallucination eval suite (`mycelium/tests/test_hallucination_eval_suite.py`) and it is passing (`11/11`).
- Added one-command ship gate (`python mycelium/ship_gate.py`) and current result is `PASS`.
- Companion local-action regression suite now stands at `12/12` passing.
- Added deterministic local handling for companion-avatar advancement prompts (including the ambiguous clarifier `i meant yours`) to prevent gateway persona drift and keep responses actionable.

Tonight was focused on one goal: close the gap between what MIST says it can do and what it actually executes on the local machine.

## The Problem We Worked
MIST was still occasionally responding like a cloud-only assistant in open conversation, even though this stack is running in a local OpenClawd environment with file and command capabilities.

That mismatch breaks trust fast.

## What Shipped Today
### 1) Deterministic local action handling got stronger
- Expanded local intent handling in `mycelium/mycelium_pulse.py` for real desktop `.md` actions.
- Added concrete handling for follow-up phrases like:
  - "did you make the .md on my computer?"
  - "no i meant the file you created"
  - "where is the file located?"
- Persisted local state (`last_created_path`) so responses stay factual across restarts.

### 2) Dashboard routing and runtime got stabilized
- Legacy dashboard routes now redirect to canonical `/dashboard`.
- Live process on port `8765` was restarted to ensure new code was actually running.
- Route checks confirmed healthy behavior after restart.

### 3) Companion dashboard was redesigned, then simplified
- Built a fresh dashboard path and cleaned old route confusion.
- Iterated visual design.
- Simplified UI/UX for clarity:
  - removed high-noise visual layers
  - merged related sections
  - reduced control density
  - preserved core operational controls

### 4) Regression tests were added
- Added focused tests in `mycelium/tests/test_companion_local_action.py` covering:
  - dashboard tutorial phrase handling
  - follow-up path confirmation
  - generic markdown creation
  - legacy dashboard redirects
- Result: `6/6` passing.

## Current Status (Honest)
Core local action reliability is significantly improved.  
Remaining issue: open-ended chat paths that fall through to gateway can still produce occasional hallucinated framing.  

Next step is to tighten the pre-gateway intent router and add stricter response validation on tool/result semantics.

## Tomorrow Schedule (Friday, February 13, 2026, America/New_York)
### 09:00-09:30 ET — Baseline + Repro Lock
- Run smoke and regression suite.
- Capture 10 known hallucination-trigger prompts.

### 09:30-11:00 ET — Intent Router Hardening
- Expand deterministic matcher before gateway fallback.
- Add confidence tiers: `local_action`, `gateway_safe`, `reject_or_clarify`.

### 11:00-12:00 ET — Anti-Hallucination Guardrail
- Add response validator for prohibited claims (fake file creation, fake command execution).
- Force explicit failure reporting when no verified action exists.

### 13:00-14:00 ET — Local Action Receipts
- Return structured receipts for local operations:
  - action id
  - path
  - timestamp
  - status

### 14:00-15:00 ET — Conversation E2E Tests
- Add scenario tests for mixed requests (chat + file ops + follow-ups).
- Verify no "cloud-only" claim when local capability exists.

### 15:00-16:00 ET — Dashboard Trust UX
- Surface last verified local action in UI.
- Add a simple "verified locally" indicator in chat responses.

### 16:00-16:30 ET — Ship + Publish Wrap
- Re-run full checks.
- Publish short X summary thread linking this article.

## Close
The architecture is now closer to truth-by-execution.  
Tomorrow is about eliminating the remaining hallucination pathways and making verification visible by default.
